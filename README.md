# Piano Simon Says
Simon says is a classic game that has been played for decades. The game is led by a designated player or computer that gives instructions for the player to follow. In this game, rather than being played through the usual four color sequence we all know and love, players will use a piano to match what Simon displays on the screen. The game starts by flashing a random key and sound, which corresponds to the particular key on the piano. For every correct key input by the player, the sequence of which keys flash becomes longer and puts their memory skills to the test. This adaptation of Simon Says allows players to improve their memory, coordination, and relative pitch.
